# Java Distributed Systems App
This is a Java distributed systems project to manage train schedules, alerts and other types of events. It was developed with a client-server architecture, and each side can be used with a GUI. The system uses Java sockets for its communication endpoints.   
   
This project was developed within the scope of Distributed Systems curricular unit of my Software Engineering degree.
